### Dev Process

Use small feature branches for development. When a feature is complete and ready to be merged, initiate a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your `feature_branch` *into* the `master` branch. Other team members will then review your changes. Once everyone agrees the feature is good to go, go ahead and merge your branch in.
